Design for Iteration-I:

In this iteration you will design, develop and test a “Plan for Smart Services” (P2S) Web-Application. P2S is an online system that aims to plan for smart green trips inside the city and its neighborhood through sharing vehicles (like Uber). Considering the traffic as a serious threat to the quality of life these years, the world has been looking for various solutions to decrease the stress, frustration, delays and terrible air pollutions being caused through it. P2S attempts to provide a smart green solution on this regard by matching up drivers who live, work, and finally drive in the same neighborhood and would like to provide trip services. P2S plans to: first accepting a trip service (ride to a place and/or deliver an item), and then finding the best match to provide that service. 

The P2S online system has the following requirements that should be implemented through several web-pages using (but not limited to) HTML5, CSS3, JavaScripts, JQuery, and other required languages/scripts at the client-side:

1-The main page contains options at the top including “Home”, “System logo”, “About us”, “Contact us”, “Sign up”, “Reviews”, “Shopping Cart”, and “Types of Services”: 

a)Ride to a destination from this source (inside the city or out of it max 50km far)

b)Ride & Deliver an item from a store (for now the only associated stores are florist and  coffee shops) In case of selecting a, b, or c, the program goes to a new separate page. The above options will appear on each page too.

2-The service page (a): Presents menus, sub-menus, images, input/output boxes and other required items to go through the following scenario steps:-System: Showing available cars, car models, prices; -User: Selecting a car; Defining source & destination addresses, date & time; Saving order in the shopping cart, -System: Showing geo-locations/path on a local Map; Making the order record; Processing the payment with the user. 

3-The service page (b): Presents menus, sub-menus, images, input/output boxes and other required items to go through the following scenario steps:-System: Showing available items, store names, prices;-User: Selecting an item; Defining source & destination addresses, date & time; Saving order in the shopping cart, -System: Showing geo-locations/path on a local Map; Making the order record; Processing the payment with the user. 

4-By selecting on the “About us” and “Contact us”, the names and contact points of the team members will appear on the screen respectively. A small bio can also appear about each team member.

5-Saving orders in the shopping cart should be done via drag & drop method.

6-To enter and use the system, a “Sign-in” mechanism should be used. Each user should be able to create an id & password and a profile including personal information (name, tel no, mailing address, email address).# P2S
